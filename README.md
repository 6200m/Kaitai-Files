# Kaitai-Files

This respository contains [Kaitai files](https://kaitai.io/) for many proprietary file formats that the Wii uses. This is useful for documenting the file structure, and these can be compiled into code for a language of your choice to parse the file structure.

Example: We used the Forecast Channel kaitai file to figure out why the data file our File-Maker script generated was invalid, without the pain of manually analyzing the problem with a hex editor.
